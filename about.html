				<p> Hello! My name is Edwin. I'll be attending the February class of the Grand Circus front-end web developer course. Prior to this venture, I was a chemical engineer. It was the worst. I don't recommend that career choice unless you enjoy observing the flow of water or getting odd skin rashes from questionable reagents. I also used to do research. My favorite color is blue. I like apples. I like the cold. </p>
